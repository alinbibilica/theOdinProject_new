# The Odin Project
## My journey to a full stack developer ()

####  The Odin Project is one of those "What I wish I had when I was learning" resources. Not everyone has access to a computer science education or the funds to attend an intensive coding school and neither of those is right for everyone anyway. This project is designed to fill in the gap for people who are trying to hack it on their own but still want a high quality education. 


The Odin Project has 3 stages:

#### Foundations (https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations)

> This is where it all begins! A hands-on introduction to all of the essential tools you'll need to build real, working websites. You'll learn what web developers actually do â€“ the foundations you'll need for later courses.
