# The Odin Project
## My journey to a full stack developer ()

####  The Odin Project is one of those "What I wish I had when I was learning" resources. Not everyone has access to a computer science education or the funds to attend an intensive coding school and neither of those is right for everyone anyway. This project is designed to fill in the gap for people who are trying to hack it on their own but still want a high quality education. 


The Odin Project has 3 stages:

#### 1. [Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations)   __COMPLETED__

> This is where it all begins! A hands-on introduction to all of the essential tools you'll need to build real, working websites. You'll learn what web developers actually do â€“ the foundations you'll need for later courses.

##### Live previous of some tasks i`ve done in the foundations stage:

- [Calculator](https://alinbibilica.github.io/theOdinProject_new/calc/)
- [Eatch - A - Sketch](https://alinbibilica.github.io/theOdinProject_new/eAs/)
- [Piano](https://alinbibilica.github.io/theOdinProject_new/drums/)
- [HexToRGB](https://alinbibilica.github.io/theOdinProject_new/hexRGB/)
- [RockPaperScissor](https://alinbibilica.github.io/theOdinProject_new/rockPaperScissors/)



#### 2. [Full Stack JavaScript](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript)

> This path takes you through our entire JavaScript curriculum. The courses should be taken in the order that they are displayed. You'll learn everything you need to know to create beautiful responsive websites from scratch using JavaScript and NodeJS.  



#### 3. [Full Stack Ruby on Rails](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails)
